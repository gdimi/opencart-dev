=================================================================

Author ------  HyperWorks
Support -----  info@hyperworks.gr


What this module does
===================
Places a side tab with a facebook page plugin of your desired facebook page. 
This is the new way of doing the already well-known facebook likebox which is already
deprecated by facebook and soon will stop working.

This is for opencart 1.5.4-1.5.6. 
It may work for previous 1.5.x versions but we haven't tested it!



How to Install
==============
Use FTP to upload the contents of "upload" folder directly to your public_html.
Go to admin->extensions->modules and install the Facebook side tab
Press [edit] to edit its options. You'll find basic usage on the bottom

If you have any problems email as at top of this txt file.
